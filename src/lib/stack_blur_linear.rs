/// Stack blur that will be performed in linear color space
///
/// Blurs in linear color space produces most pleasant results and mathematically correct to do so however significantly slower.
/// This method is significantly slower than regular `u8` stack blur in perceptual colorspace.
/// This is a very fast approximation using f32 accumulator size with radius less that *BASE_RADIUS_F64_CUTOFF*,
/// after it to avoid overflowing fallback to f64 accumulator will be used with some computational slowdown with factor ~1.5-2
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `in_place` - mutable buffer contains image data that will be used as a source and destination
/// * `stride` - Bytes per lane, default is width * channels_count if not aligned
/// * `width` - image width
/// * `height` - image height
/// * `radius` - since f32 accumulator is used under the hood radius almost is not limited
/// * `channels` - Count of channels of the image, only 3 and 4 is supported, alpha position, and channels order does not matter
/// * `threading_policy` - Threads usage policy
/// * `transfer_function` - Transfer function in linear colorspace
///
/// # Complexity
/// O(1) complexity.
